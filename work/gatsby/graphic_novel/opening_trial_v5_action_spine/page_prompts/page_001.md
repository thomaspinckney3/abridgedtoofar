[1] words 1-23
In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I've been turning over in my mind ever since.


[2] words 24-48
"Whenever you feel like criticizing anyone," he told me, "just remember that all the people in this world haven't had the advantages that you've had."


[3] words 49-75
He didn't say any more, but we've always been unusually communicative in a reserved way, and I understood that he meant a great deal more than that.


[4] words 76-106
In consequence, I'm inclined to reserve all judgements, a habit that has opened up many curious natures to me and also made me the victim of not a few veteran bores.


[5] words 107-154
The abnormal mind is quick to detect and attach itself to this quality when it appears in a normal person, and so it came about that in college I was unjustly accused of being a politician, because I was privy to the secret griefs of wild, unknown men.


[6] words 155-210
Most of the confidences were unsought—frequently I have feigned sleep, preoccupation, or a hostile levity when I realized by some unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was quivering on the horizon; for the intimate revelations of young men, or at least the terms in which they express them, are usually plagiaristic and marred by obvious suppressions.


[7] words 211-218
Reserving judgements is a matter of infinite hope.


[8] words 219-252
I am still a little afraid of missing something if I forget that, as my father snobbishly suggested, and I snobbishly repeat, a sense of the fundamental decencies is parcelled out unequally at birth.



Rules:
- Preserve source-unit order exactly.
- Cover every assigned source unit. Do not omit a source unit from the page.
- The page's `source_unit_ids` must be the complete assigned list in order.
- The panels' `source_unit_ids`, read in panel order, must cover the complete
  assigned list in order. No gaps.
- Do not include content from later source units.
- Do not include content from prior source units except as visual continuity.
- Build each page around a concrete action spine: the reader should always know
  where Nick physically is, what he is doing, and why the next panel follows.
- For abstract exposition, do not create detached symbolic tableaux. Attach the
  narration to visible behavior such as writing, packing, arriving, walking,
  reading, speaking with another person, looking from a window, or entering a
  room.
- For geography, avoid standalone map/aerial context unless it is anchored to a
  character's route or vantage. Prefer concrete movement: train, station, road,
  ferry/shoreline, bungalow, window, neighboring estate, and line-of-sight.
- Each page summary should state the physical action first, then the abstract
  meaning. Example shape: "Nick returns home and begins writing; while he does,
  he recalls..."
- Each panel beat must be an observable action or decision, not only a theme.
- If these source units express chronology or cause/effect, make that sequence explicit in the panel beats and captions.
- Do not collapse chronology into a symbolic montage when separate panels would make the sequence clearer.
- Each panel must map to one source unit or adjacent source units.
- Dialogue must come from these source units when possible. If there is no dialogue, use a caption instead of invented speech.
- Image prompts are for art only: no readable text, no captions, no labels, no signs, no speech balloons, no lettering. Leave negative space where lettering can be added later.
- Keep image prompts concrete: setting, action, blocking, expression, lighting, period costume, and mood.
- If the source is mostly context-setting, use a recurring frame action to hold
  it together rather than scattering unrelated images.
- If you need a montage, explain why in `adaptation_note`.
