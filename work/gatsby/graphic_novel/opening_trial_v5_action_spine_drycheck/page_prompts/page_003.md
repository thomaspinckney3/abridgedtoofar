[17] words 508-528
I graduated from New Haven in 1915, and later took part in that delayed Teutonic migration known as the Great War.


[18] words 529-539
I enjoyed the counter-raid so thoroughly that I came back restless.


[19] words 540-570
Instead of being the warm centre of the world, the Middle West now seemed like the ragged edge of the universe—so I decided to go East and learn the bond business.


[20] words 571-593
Father agreed to finance me for a year, and after various delays I came East, permanently, I thought, in the spring of twenty-two.


[21] words 594-647
The practical thing was to find rooms in the city, but it was a warm season, and I had just left a country of wide lawns and friendly trees, so when a young man at the office suggested that we take a house together in a commuting town, it sounded like a great idea.


[22] words 648-678
He found the house, a weather-beaten cardboard bungalow at eighty a month, but at the last minute the firm ordered him to Washington, and I went out to the country alone.


[23] words 679-718
I had a dog—at least I had him for a few days until he ran away—and an old Dodge and a Finnish woman, who made my bed and cooked breakfast and muttered Finnish wisdom to herself over the electric stove.


[24] words 719-741
It was lonely for a day or so until one morning some man, more recently arrived than I, stopped me on the road.


[25] words 742-752
"How do you get to West Egg village?" he asked helplessly.


[26] words 753-755
I told him.



Rules:
- Preserve source-unit order exactly.
- Cover every assigned source unit. Do not omit a source unit from the page.
- The page's `source_unit_ids` must be the complete assigned list in order.
- The panels' `source_unit_ids`, read in panel order, must cover the complete
  assigned list in order. No gaps.
- Do not include content from later source units.
- Do not include content from prior source units except as visual continuity.
- Build each page around a concrete action spine: the reader should always know
  where Nick physically is, what he is doing, and why the next panel follows.
- For abstract exposition, do not create detached symbolic tableaux. Attach the
  narration to visible behavior such as writing, packing, arriving, walking,
  reading, speaking with another person, looking from a window, or entering a
  room.
- For geography, avoid standalone map/aerial context unless it is anchored to a
  character's route or vantage. Prefer concrete movement: train, station, road,
  ferry/shoreline, bungalow, window, neighboring estate, and line-of-sight.
- Each page summary should state the physical action first, then the abstract
  meaning. Example shape: "Nick returns home and begins writing; while he does,
  he recalls..."
- Each panel beat must be an observable action or decision, not only a theme.
- If these source units express chronology or cause/effect, make that sequence explicit in the panel beats and captions.
- Do not collapse chronology into a symbolic montage when separate panels would make the sequence clearer.
- Each panel must map to one source unit or adjacent source units.
- Dialogue must come from these source units when possible. If there is no dialogue, use a caption instead of invented speech.
- Image prompts are for art only: no readable text, no captions, no labels, no signs, no speech balloons, no lettering. Leave negative space where lettering can be added later.
- Keep image prompts concrete: setting, action, blocking, expression, lighting, period costume, and mood.
- If the source is mostly context-setting, use a recurring frame action to hold
  it together rather than scattering unrelated images.
- If you need a montage, explain why in `adaptation_note`.
