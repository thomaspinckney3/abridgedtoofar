[35] words 973-999
It was on that slender riotous island which extends itself due east of New York—and where there are, among other natural curiosities, two unusual formations of land.


[36] words 1000-1041
Twenty miles from the city a pair of enormous eggs, identical in contour and separated only by a courtesy bay, jut out into the most domesticated body of salt water in the Western hemisphere, the great wet barnyard of Long Island Sound.


[37] words 1042-1058
To the wingless a more interesting phenomenon is their dissimilarity in every particular except shape and size.


[38] words 1059-1089
I lived at West Egg, the—well, the less fashionable of the two, though this is a most superficial tag to express the bizarre and not a little sinister contrast between them.


[39] words 1090-1120
My house was at the very tip of the egg, only fifty yards from the Sound, and squeezed between two huge places that rented for twelve or fifteen thousand a season.


[40] words 1121-1172
The one on my right was a colossal affair by any standard—it was a factual imitation of some Hôtel de Ville in Normandy, with a tower on one side, spanking new under a thin beard of raw ivy, and a marble swimming pool, and more than forty acres of lawn and garden.


[41] words 1173-1176
It was Gatsby's mansion.


[42] words 1177-1195
Or, rather, as I didn't know Mr. Gatsby, it was a mansion inhabited by a gentleman of that name.


[43] words 1196-1238
My own house was an eyesore, but it was a small eyesore, and it had been overlooked, so I had a view of the water, a partial view of my neighbour's lawn, and the consoling proximity of millionaires—all for eighty dollars a month.



Rules:
- Preserve source-unit order exactly.
- Do not include content from later source units.
- Do not include content from prior source units except as visual continuity.
- If these source units express chronology or cause/effect, make that sequence explicit in the panel beats and captions.
- Do not collapse chronology into a symbolic montage when separate panels would make the sequence clearer.
- Each panel must map to one source unit or adjacent source units.
- Dialogue must come from these source units when possible. If there is no dialogue, use a caption instead of invented speech.
- Image prompts are for art only: no readable text, no captions, no labels, no signs, no speech balloons, no lettering. Leave negative space where lettering can be added later.
- Keep image prompts concrete: setting, action, blocking, expression, lighting, period costume, and mood.
- If you need a montage, explain why in `adaptation_note`.
