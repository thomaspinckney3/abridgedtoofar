Review one generated graphic-novel frame against its storyboard contract.

Return strict JSON only. Do not include prose outside JSON.

Your job is not to judge taste. Your job is to catch automation failures that
will break a source-grounded graphic adaptation:

- recurring character appearance drift
- recurring or archaic prop confusion
- literalized similes, metaphors, idioms, memories, or jokes
- unsupported people, animals, objects, labels, symbols, or events
- readable text in the image
- the frame focusing on a supporting detail instead of the primary action
- caption-zone failure, where the reserved area is too busy for later lettering

Use the image itself as evidence. A finding is valid only if it is visible.
If a storyboard instruction is merely absent from the image but the omission
does not harm continuity or story comprehension, mark it minor or omit it.
